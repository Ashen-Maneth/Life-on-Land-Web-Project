      <h6>User Profile</h6>
      <p>
        The user profile page facilitates seamless updating of personal details through a
        step-by-step form. With progress indicators and intuitive navigation buttons, users can
        effortlessly navigate, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience.

      <h6>Team</h6>
      <p>
        The Team Page features profile cards showcasing team members' names, roles, and
        contributions, surrounded by a stylish design. Each card elegantly reveals member details
        upon hover. It's a visually engaging presentation highlighting team cohesion and individual
        expertise.

      <h6>Content Page</h6>
      <p>
        It was my responsibility to create a new content page that complemented the website's theme.
        The page needed to be long enough to support internal linking. I added top-of-page links to
        lengthier pages to make it simple to navigate between sections.
