        <h2>Introduction to Forests</h2>
        <p>Forests are expansive ecosystems dominated by trees and diverse flora and fauna. They play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of our planet, serving as habitats for countless species, regulating climate patterns, purifying air and water, and providing essential resources for human societies. Forests come in various types, ranging from tropical rainforests with dense canopies to boreal forests characterized by coniferous trees. They hold immense cultural significance and have been integral to human survival and development throughout history, supplying timber, food, medicine, and spiritual inspiration. However, forests face numerous threats, including deforestation, climate change, habitat destruction, and unsustainable land use practices, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these invaluable ecosystems for future generations.</p>

        <h2>Types of Forests</h2>
        <p>Forests can be classified into several types based on factors such as climate, vegetation, and location. Here are some of the main types of forests:</p>
        
        <h3>Tropical Forests</h3>
        <p>These forests are characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. They are typically found near the equator and feature dense vegetation with towering trees forming a continuous canopy. Tropical rainforests harbor the highest levels of biodiversity on Earth, with countless species of plants, animals, and insects.</p>
