          All life on Earth depends on water. Drinking, cleaning, farming, transportation,
          generating energy, and recreation all require freshwater. Though they make up less than 1%
          of the earth's surface, freshwater ecosystems such as lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands
          are home to about 10% of all known animal species and roughly 50% of all known fish
          species.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Wetlands, which are aquatic areas with a freshwater, saltwater, or mixed cover, are one of
          these freshwater habitats that are sometimes overlooked. They are the planet's natural
          carbon storage and waste-water treatment facilities. And they are essential to the
          security of food. There are between 300 million and 400 million people who depend on
          wetlands and live near them. They are in favor of rice farming, which is a staple food for
          half of the world's population. They also supply essential habitat, supplies, medications,
          clean water, protection from storms and shorelines, and flood management.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Despite the importance of wetlands to human populations, up to 87% of the world's wetlands
          have disappeared over the last 300 years, with the majority of this loss occurring around
          1900. In order to preserve and safeguard these priceless habitats, WWF works.<br /><br />Learn

        <div id="topic-underline"></div>
        <br />
        <p>
          A wetland is an area of land that is continually or seasonally covered in water, whether
          it be fresh, salt, or somewhere in between. It operates as a separate ecology of its own.
          Wetland distinguishes itself from other land uses and water bodies mainly by its
          vegetation, which has adapted to the damp soil.

        <br />
        <p>
          Wetlands are home to a diverse range of animals. During their lengthy migrations, wetlands
          serve as rest stops for a variety of birds, including sandpipers, kingfishers, ducks, and
          geese, giving them food and shelter. Wetlands provide food and refuge for a variety of
          mammals, including tigers, beavers, and otters. Naturally, marshes are home to a wide
          variety of fish.

        <p>
          Among the world's largest wetlands are the Hudson Bay Lowland, the Amazon River Basin, and
          the West Siberian Lowland. Llanos de Moxos, in Bolivia, is the largest protected wetland
          in the world. It is more than 17 million acres, or almost the same as North Dakota.

        <div id="topic-underline4"></div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Wetlands alter nitrogen so that it is easier for plants to absorb, trap pollutants like
          phosphorus and heavy metals in their soils, and physically and chemically decompose
          bacteria. By acquiring and protecting $1.5 billion in land surrounding its upstate
          reservoirs, New York City discovered that it could avoid spending $3 billion to $8 billion
          on new wastewater treatment facilities.

        <p>
          Rivers, marshes, bogs, mangroves, mudflats, ponds, billabongs, lagoons, lakes, and
          floodplains are a few examples of wetlands. The majority of sizable wetland areas
          frequently have a variety of freshwater systems.

        <div id="topic-underline6"></div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Although they only make up a small percentage of the earth, wetlands are highly effective
          at absorbing carbon dioxide. They aid in preventing the release of the heat-trapping gas
          that fuels climate change from the atmosphere by storing 50 times more carbon than rain
          forests. Wetlands draw debris with a high carbon content, such as leaves and animal feces,
          down from the water's surface. The wetlands' natural debris is hidden by the sediment and
          water, keeping them hidden. Wetlands also have the advantage of growing swiftly and
          staying stable over long periods of time, which allows them to absorb carbon from the
          atmosphere.

        <div id="topic-underline7"></div>
        <br />
        <p>
          A national program called the Freshwater Challenge seeks to mobilize the necessary
          resources to guarantee that 350 million hectares of degraded wetlands and 300,000
          kilometers of degraded rivers would be restored by 2030. The United States accepted the
          Freshwater Challenge in December along with forty-three other nations!

        <div id="topic-underline8"></div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Development, agriculture, aquaculture, climate change, pollution, and dams are some of the
          issues facing wetlands. WWF promotes climate change adaptation and supports the Freshwater
          Challenge as part of its global efforts to protect wetlands.
